                <h3 class="blog-title">var, let, const</h3>
                <p>These keywords are used to declare variable in JavaScript. They have different rules for scope,
                    reassignment and hoisting. <strong>var</strong> is the function scoped means that the variable can
                    only
                    be accessed
                    within the function where it is declared, and not outside of it. <strong>let</strong> and
                    <strong>const</strong> is the block scoped means
                    that the variable can only be accessed within the block where it is declared, and not outside of it.
                    A
                    block is a section of code enclosed by curly braces {...}
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="blog-title">null and undefined</h3>
                <p><strong>null</strong> means there is no value. It is used to represent empty.
                    <strong>undefined</strong>
                    means a variable has not been assigned a value or a property does not exist on an object.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3 class="blog-title">REST API</h3>
                <p> A representation is the way a resource is presented to the client, such as JSON, XML, HTML, etc. A
                    REST
                    API allows the client to interact with the resources on the server by using standard HTTP methods,
                    such
                    as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. Each method has a specific meaning and purpose for manipulating the
                    resources. A REST API is one of the most common and popular ways of building web-based APIs, as it
                    offers many benefits, such as simplicity, scalability, interoperability, and extensibility.</p>
